Results overview from Round 19 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a non-linear Public Template application prototype on desktop and mobile. The following patterns were evaluated in Round 19 Testing:

- PRO Template Themes
- PRO Template Header Links
- Badge (w/Border) (Readability)
- Show/Hide with Badge
- Figure
- Summary (Show/Hide) (Mobile View)

- Mega-Select (Check)
- Button (Toggle) – A/B/C Testing
- Table
  - Chart View
  - Advanced Filter
  - Column Settings
    - Reorder
    - Show/Hide

## Methodology

The UXG UEF team conducted usability testing with six participants on September 14-18, 2020. The evaluations took place via Skype Sessions. Evaluations were conducted on desktop computers and a mobile emulator. Five participants tested on mobile and 13 tested on desktop.

Standard remote usability testing was the method of choice during round 19. There were 18 total participants.

During each evaluation, participants walked through a series of scenarios that allowed them to look at each of the patterns being tested. The prototype design was a fictitious healthcare website. The prototype was built with HTML and Axure.

After the evaluations were complete, the team analyzed the results including:

- Facilitator Guide metrics on ease of use;
- Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
- User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in the post-test questionnaire.

## Participant Information

Eighteen participants were involved in the evaluations. Their demographic information was as follows:

- Participants were between the ages of 26 and 70 with an average age of 36-55.
- Seventeen out of eighteen participants had a degree of higher education (4-year or graduate)
  - 7 participant had a graduate degree
  - 10 participants had a 4-year degree
- 8 out of 18 participants access the internet on a Desktop, Tablet and Smartphone

## Lessons Learned

The UXG team discussed lessons learned from this round of testing. Those included the following:

- Skype for session recording was successful

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the UEF Workgroup as follows. Each has a target of 80%.

- Completion Rate – Percentage of participants who successfully completed the application without assistance
- Ease of Use – Percentage of participants who indicated the application was “easy” or “very easy” to use, as measured by Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
- User Satisfaction – Percentage of participants who indicated they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied,” as measured by questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target  | Actual  |
|---|---|---|
|Completion Rate|> 80%|100%|
|Ease of Use|> 80%|88%|
|User Satisfaction|> 80%|81%|

### Qualitative Assessment

This section discusses the usability issues, as well as observations and participant comments. The patterns tested within this evaluation group the findings.

#### **Pro Template Themes**

1. 18/18  Participants successfully understood the different themes (100%).
2. 6 participants preferred the default theme
3. 6 participants preferred the blue theme
4. 3 participants preferred the purple theme
5. P1 DEFAULT: It’s the standard. Nothing wrong with it, just boring.  BLUE: Blue is not bad. RED: Not a fan of the red. It’s more of a burnt orangey red. PURPLE: Nice cool color. An eye grabber.
6. P3 DEFAULT: SSA work-life BLUE: Standard RED: “A little pep” PURPLE: For people who want to switch it up a bit. DEFAULT: means SSA work life
7. P9 DEFAULT: most consistent to SSA colors BLUE: hard to see that tabs are clickable RED: indicates warning and errors, hard to see that tabs are clickable PURPLE: not preferable for SSA pages, more for Power Point docs
8. P19 PURPLE: it makes me feel happy

#### **Badge (w/Border) (Readability)**

1. 17 out of 18 participants had no issues
2. P1 noticed the badge right away.
3. P10 It stands out but everything is new to me.
4. P11 I like it and noticed it right away.

#### **Summary Show/Hide with Badge**

1. 15/18 successfully expanded and collapsed the tabs, 3 had difficulty (83%)
2. 18/18 Participants understood the badge (100%)
3. P1 I would personally still prefer to it expanded by default because then I can see my questions with the answers and then collapse it once I’ve reviewed the answers, so I know which ones I have reviewed.  Would still prefer to see them expanded. Can collapse them herself if she want to.
4. P3 Understood that many responses would mean closed drop downs as a default mode to save space. Closed, add instructions to click on arrow and update the information if needed.
5. P10 If more than three, then it may be okay to collapse, as it can be cumbersome to have so many items open. Perhaps, if something is wrong with the input when something has an issue or incomplete. Mentioned that it should depend on the business rules.

#### **Figure**

1. 17/18 participants understood the figure was an image. (94%)
2. 15/18 participants successfully identified the caption. (83%)
3. Liked the idea of providing Zoom
4. P4: Typical caption, easy enough (prefer it to be top left on the image itself)
5. Mentioned his experience on viewing images on eBay. Expected to be able to enlarge the image on phone by stretching it.
6. If you want somebody to see first the caption then we can put it on the top of the image.

#### **Summary (Show/Hide) (Mobile View)**

1. 5/5 Mobile participants had no issues
2. P1 : Easy to understand.
3. P3 : Green check mark indicates it is completed.

#### **Mega-Select (Radio)**

1. 18/18 participants used the scroll bar to view all options (100%)
2. 18/18 participants successfully selected the save button (100%)
3. P1 pretty straight forward, would not change
4. P2 When selecting state the save button shows (X selected) and this implies that multiple options can be selected. Maybe disable save button until a selection is made helpful in conjunction with a predefined list. Search does not belong here. You don’t need the search if you have a predetermined list.
5. P15 Circle needs to be more darker
6. P16 Order is left to right- I would prefer to be top to bottom then left to right
7. P17 Would not change anything

#### **Multi-Select (Check)**

1. 16/18 participants used the scroll bar to view all options (89%)
2. 17/18 participants successfully saved the selections (94%)
3. P18 Pretty clear page. He suggested reset button.
4. P19 questioned the purpose of the search. Decided that search is not helpful in conjuction with a predefined list. Search does not belong here.  You don’t need the search if you have a predetermined list.”
5. P19 Did not immediately see the scroll, but ultimately did find it. Preferred to see all issues on the one screen and not having to scroll. Suggested to move extra options to the next if it does not fit. (User had issues finding items-ignored the scroll)”It was an easy checkbox, I wasn’t looking for the scroll. It would be nice to see everything at once.”
6. Most participants wanted to see the options in Alphabetical order
7. P2,P3,P4 All suggested allowing the user to add an option that was not there.

#### **Button (Toggle) –A/B/C Testing**

1. 18/18 participants had no issues
2. P1:  1 - I like it because it fills the whole area and it’s got the little indicator. No confusion, very clear.
3. P2:  The arrow implies the selection was made. The third option does this well, too. But I like the 1st option better.
4. P3: Likes both 1 and 2, lens towards 2. Likes the indicator arrow, but is too small.
5. P4: Looks more completed to me (number 1 has arrow that barrely visible)1 and 2
6. P8: I liked 1 or 2. The triangle in number 1 makes me think something is wrong with my screen. Definitely prefer number 2

#### **Table (Chart View)**

1. 17/18  participants had no issues ( 1participant had difficulty)
2. P3 : Wants another color. Blue is already in the heading and used in links. Maybe purple or gray or something. Do another color (we already have blue in the top), Easy to read.
3. P7:  Looks fancy
4. P10: Liked to enlarge the bar chart
5. P12: Charts are very useful for comparing
6. P15: Easy to read. Understands what it is saying.
7. P16: Prefers the bar graph and it’s fine.
8. P17: Easy to understand. Would click on the bar, line or pie. All of these graphics provide me with info. After expanding the Bar chart, even better.
9. P18: He likes the chart easier to read, pie charts are hard to read but bar charts are good.

#### **Table (Advanced Filter)**

1. 14/18 participants successfully located the filter. 2 had difficulty (Desktop Users), The 2 that were unsuccessful were mobile users.
2. P1: I’m familiar with filters so that’s where I went first. Unsure what column settings and chart view mean.
3. P2: The filter icon is familiar, they have seen it before.
4. P3 and P4: Mobile Users – Did not understand that filter would be under settings.
5. P9: I don’t think it was difficult, I prefer the term “Search” instead of filtering. I was able to filter on any of these fields.
6. P11: I like how it was presented.

#### **Table (Column Settings)(Reorder, Show/Hide)**

1. 12/13 Desktop participants had no issues (1 participant had difficulty).
2. P1: pretty straightforward, easy.  Green is good.
3. P3: She removed columns quickly, no problems. Instructional icons next to the action they control instead. Click on X and apply to table. Green means go or money. It’s good. Safe color in this scenario.
4. P7:  would prefer to reorder columns in the actual table.
5. P9: Removing the columns was easy. The green color stands out.
6. P13:  It was simple.
7. P15:  liked it self-explanatory. Thought green color was ugly, not favorite shade of green.
8. P16:  Click and drag fine
9. P17:  Very easy
