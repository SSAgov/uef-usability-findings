# Mobile UEF Pattern Testing Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 9 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The Mobile UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a linear application on mobile and desktop devices. The existing iClaim application was modified to evaluate particular patterns, including:

- Date (Calendar)
- Multi-Select Modal
- Single-Row Action Table (new pattern)
- Pagination Table (new pattern)
- Review Summary Error
- Document Viewer
- Portal Navigation (for devices with viewports > 768 pixels)
- Username (Create)

Testing was conducted on the following types of devices:

- Smartphones (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (iOS and Android)

## The Prototype

### Design

The existing iClaim application was modified to incorporate several new patterns. The team chose a linear path application in order to test the new Single-Row Action Table and Pagination Table patterns. Each screen within the path incorporated at least one pattern being evaluated. Due to limitations of the Axure prototyping software, the tool was not used to create Single-Row Action Table and Pagination Table patterns.

### Viewport Sizes

As with prior responsive prototypes used in Mobile UEF testing, this prototype was designed with a single breakpoint.

The devices with a viewport size of less than 768 pixels when used in portrait view included: the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6 Plus.

The devices with a viewport size of 768 and larger included the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and iPad.

The viewport sizes for each mobile device used in this round of testing are as follows:

| Mobile Device  | Viewport Size  | Operating System  |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone 5  | 320 x 568  | iOS  |
| Samsung Galaxy S3  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| Samsung Galaxy S5  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| Samsung Galaxy Note 4  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| iPhone 6  | 375 x 667  | iOS  |
| iPhone 6 Plus  | 414 x 736  | iOS  |
| iPad  | 768 x 1024  | iOS  |
| Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1  | 800 x 1280  | Android  |

## What We Did

With members of the general public, Mobile UEF Team members:

- Conducted user testing with 15 participants on May 7, 2015 at the Baltimore County Public Library (Towson Branch).
  - Fifteen participants tested on one of the following types of devices:
    - Smartphone: 10 total participants
      - 3 using an iPhone 5
      - 2 using an iPhone 6
    - 1 using an iPhone 6 plus
      - 1 using a Samsung Galaxy S3
      - 2 using a Samsung Galaxy S5
    - 1 using a Samsung Galaxy Note 4
    - Tablet: 5 total participants
      - 3 using an iPad
      - 2 using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
    - No desktop users were tested.
- Collected participant information in a pre-test demographic survey, which indicated:
  - Participants ranged in age from 17 to 74, with a median age of 45;
  - All 15 participants owned and used at least one type of mobile device;
  - Seven participants had used Social Security’s online services;
  - Four participants would use a smartphone to access SSA.gov or a MySocialSecurity account.
- Analyzed the results, including:
  - Navigation methods and preferences;
  - Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
  - User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in a post-test questionnaire.

## Challenges & Constraints

As with prior Mobile UEF testing sessions, recruiting of volunteer participants was performed on-site during the testing session with outreach to a broad range of library patrons. The usability test scenario and tasks were designed to be completed within 15-20 minutes; prior mobile testing had shown this time range yielded the optimal balance of participants and data in any single day.

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the Mobile UEF Workgroup as follows:

- **Completion Rate** – Percentage of participants who successfully completed the application without assistance
  - Target > 80% for each device type
- **Ease of Use** – Percentage of participants who indicated the application was “very easy” to use, as measured by Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
  - Target > 80% for each device type
- **User Satisfaction** – Percentage of participants who indicated they were “very satisfied,” as measured by questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey
  - Target > 80% for each device type

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target (All Devices)  | Actual Smart Phone  | Actual Tablet  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate  | >=80%  | 95.1%  | 100%  |
| Ease of Use  | >=80%  | 82%  | 78.7%  |
| User Satisfaction  | >=80%  | 88%  | 76%  |

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Based on this round of testing, the following patterns were found to be problematic for enough participants to necessitate retesting or design refinements:

- Date (Calendar) for “Clear” button only
- Multi-Select Modal
- Single-Row Table
- Pagination Table

Pattern recommendations based on the findings are below.

| Pattern  | Recommendation  |  Rationale  |
|---|---|---|
| Date (Calendar)  | Remove the “Clear” button from the modal and provide “clear date field” functionality near/in the field.  |   Users were not sure what action to expect with the “Clear” button.|
| Multi-Select Modal  | 1. Keep selected items in place (remove jumping functionality) and indicate they are selected. 2. For devices with a viewport more than 767 pixels, make the left and right arrows more prominent. 3. Keep the “Selected” button as designed.4. Users did not like the jumping of selected items and prefer for them to stay in place, but be highlighted. 5. Users had difficulty noticing the left and right navigation arrows. 6. Users acknowledged the number change in the “Selected” button after saving.  |   |
| Single-Row Action Table | Re-evaluate the table icons used, despite workgroup research and replace the chevron with a different icon.  | Users thought that the chevron resembled a check mark.Some users expected the entire row to be clickable.|
| Pagination Table  | Keep the current pagination design.  |   There were no major issues.|
| Review Summary Error  | Keep the current design.  |   There were no major issues.|
| Document Viewer  | Keep the current design.  |   Users stated that they liked being able to see the original screen in the background.|
| Portal Navigation  | Keep the current design.  |   There were no major issues.|
| Username (Create)  | Keep the current design, but turn off the device’s auto-correct and auto-complete functionality for both the username and password fields. |  Users had difficulty using the device’s keyboard with the auto-correct and auto-complete functionality turned on.|

Recommendations for future testing rounds are below.

| Recommendation  |  Rationale  |
|---|---|
|Bring a stylus for the next round of testing, but provide it only at the participant’s request.| Users had physical difficulty using touch-screen devices with large fingers.|
