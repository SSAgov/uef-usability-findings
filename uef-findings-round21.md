# Round 21 DST Component Testing Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 21 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The Design System Team (DST) conducted usability testing to evaluate specific patterns in the context of an unmoderated Template application prototype on desktop devices.

The following patterns were evaluated in Round 21 Testing:

- Address (Business)
- Container (Drag and Drop Rows)
- International Input Field Toggle Update
- Multi-Select
- Lists (Drag and Drop)
- Table Sort Icon and Row Banding
- Table Advanced Filter
- Table Column Customization
- Table Mobile Layout Sort
- Table Mobile Layout Advanced Filter
- Table Mobile Layout Column Customization.

## Methodology

DST conducted usability testing using an unmoderated testing platform on August 27, 2021. The evaluations took place remotely via a new unmoderated testing platform. All evaluations were conducted on desktop computers.

Unmoderated testing was the method of choice during round 21. There were a total of 26 participants.The prototype was built with HTML and Axure. The team gathered Satisfaction User Scores (SUS) for each component in order to gather usability feedback. On a scale of 1-7, 1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy, users were asked to rate the use of each component. The Design System Team aims for a Satisfaction User Score greater than or equal to five for each component in addition to examining user comments.

After the evaluations were complete, the team analyzed the results including:

- Facilitator Guide metrics on ease of use.
- Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details.

## Participant Information

26 participants were involved in the evaluations. Their demographic information was as follows:

- 46% Female, 50% Male and 4% did not identify
- 62% of evaluators were in the range of 36-55 years old.
- 65% IT Specialists, 8% Analyst, 4% Branch Chiefs, 4% Senior Engineer, 4% Team Leads, 4% Tech Specialist, 4% IT Supervisor and 7% did not declare their job title
- 12 out of 26 participants have a 4-year degree
- 12 out of 26 participants have a graduate degree
- 1 out of 26 participants have some college
- 1 out of 26 participants did not answer

## Lessons Learned

DST discussed lessons learned from this round of testing. Those included the following:

- How we word both the communications that go out to potential participants and the Welcome page may have significant impact on the number of test participants we actually get. Allow everyone to participate, regardless of past participation.
- The more Tasks we include in an evaluation, the slower the evaluation web site becomes, since the Unmoderated Test Platform is a Single-Page Application (SPA). (And yes–it's already using lazy loading to try to speed things up.) Since we have had evaluations with 10 and 11 tasks, let's try to keep the next evaluation round to 8 or less and monitor the response times.
- For the next evaluation, we may want to try using a SHE (Shared Hosting Environment) server, since we have direct control over that type of server and those servers are optimized for speed.
- Emphasize even more that this is strictly a prototype and not everything will fully function.
- Not everyone looks at the DCS Communications emails - maybe have it go directly to the branches so the branch chief can distribute to their personnel directly.
- Send reminder half way through to get more responses
- Add information about providing details for the UXG Evaluation Participation badge
- Reach out to OLMER/MSS for union consent ASAP to avoid pushing dates back 0.851 CTR working 25% with UXG
