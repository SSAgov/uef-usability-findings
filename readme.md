# SSA Design System Usability Test Findings

## Background

A design system is a definition of visual style and interactions, achieved via a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Design system takes several steps to build a pattern right from researching industry standards to prototyping, usability testing and then developing it.

**All of our components are used each day by millions of Americans. For this reason, each pattern in our library is designed and tested with real users to solve real problems.**

Here are the benefits to using a design system:

1. Provides a uniform user experience across an enterprise
2. A Unified Language
3. Solves Problems Holistically and At Scale
4. Defines Usage Guidelines
5. Uses a Well-Defined Process for Extending the System
6. 508 Accessibiltiy integrated into UEF
7. Usability tested

## Testing Results
