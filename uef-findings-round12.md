# Round 12 UEF Pattern Testing Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 12 of the user feedback sessions (conducted on June 7, 2017 @ Howard County Library, Miller Branch)

## Background

The UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a linear application on mobile and desktop devices.
The following patterns were evaluated in Round 12 Testing:

- Dropdown Button
- Loading Button
- Progress
- Popover
- Full Page Calendar
- Tree Structure

Testing was conducted on the following types of devices: Smartphones (iOS and Android), Tablets (iOS), and Laptop (Windows)

## The Prototype

The prototype was designed to incorporate two separate scenarios. The first scenario walked the participant through a fake MySSA application testing all patterns listed above except one. The Tree Structure pattern was shown in the second scenario, time permitting.

## Viewport Sizes

As with prior responsive prototypes used in Mobile UEF testing, this prototype was designed with a single breakpoint.
The devices with a viewport size of less than 768 pixels when used in portrait view included: the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S3.
The devices with a viewport size of 768 and larger included the iPad and Laptop.

The viewport sizes for each mobile device used in this round of testing are as follows:

| Mobile Device  | Viewport Size  | Operating System  |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone 5  | 320 x 568  | iOS  |
| Samsung Galaxy S3  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| iPad  | 768 x 1024  | iOS  |
| Laptop | 768 x 1024   | Windows  |

## What We Did

With members of the general public, Mobile UEF Team members:

- Conducted user testing with 15 participants on June 8 , 2016 at the Howard County Public Library, Miller Branch location in Ellicott City, MD
  - Fifteen participants tested on one of the following types of devices:
    - Smartphone: 8 total participants
      - 4 using an iPhone 5
      - 4 using a Samsung Galaxy S3
    - Tablet: 4 total participants
      - 4 using an iPad
    - Laptop: 3 Total participants
      - 3 using an HP Laptop
- Collected participant information in a pre-test demographic survey, which indicated:
  - Participants ranged in age from 24 to 77, with a median age of 54;
  - All 15 participants own and use at least one type of mobile device;
  - Fourteen participants use their mobile device to complete one or more online activities;
  - Five participants have used Social Security’s online services;
  - Six participants would use a smartphone (2) or tablet (4) to access SSA.gov or a MySocialSecurity account.
- Analyzed the results, including:
  - Navigation methods and preferences;
  - Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
  - User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in a post-test questionnaire.

## Challenges & Constraints

As with prior Mobile UEF testing sessions, recruiting of volunteer participants was performed on-site during the testing session with outreach to a broad range of library patrons. The usability test scenario and tasks were designed to be completed within 10 minutes; prior mobile testing had shown this time range yielded the optimal balance of participants and data in any single day.

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the Mobile UEF Workgroup as follows:

- Completion Rate – Percentage of participants who successfully completed the application without assistance
  - Target > 80% for each device type
- Ease of Use – Percentage of participants who indicated the application was “easy” or “very easy” to use, as measured by Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
  - Target > 80% for each device type
- User Satisfaction – Percentage of participants who indicated they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied,” as measured by questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey
  - Target > 80% for each device type

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target (All Devices)  | Actual SmartPhone  | Actual Tablet  | LapTop |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate  | >=80%  | 99%  | 98%  |85%|
| Ease of Use  | >=80%  | 85%  | 80%  |95%|
| User Satisfaction  | >=80%  | 94%  | 70%  |95%|

### Qualitative Assessment

This section discusses the usability issues, as well as observations and participant comments. The patterns tested within this evaluation group the findings.

### **Dropdown Button**

1. Fourteen out of 15 participants successfully opened the Dropdown Button.
2. There were no major issues with use or understandability.
3. One participant wanted to see the options outside of the drop down. (This comment was towards the app as a whole rather than the pattern directly.)

### **Loading Button**

1. All 15 participants understood what the loading button was doing.
2. All participants found the loading button to be useful.
3. One participant thought it was calculating.

### **Progress**

1. Thirteen of 15 participants were confused by the Progress pattern.
2. Several participants expected the pattern to be interactive and was frustrated when it was static.
3. All users eventually selected the Help link after attempting to select the progress bar.
4. One participant was surprised to see the help icon.

### **Popover**

The popover was tested from the Progress pattern Help Link.

1. Most participants did not expect a popover from the Help Link.
2. A few participants had difficulty dismissing the popover, especially on smaller screens.
3. Comments were specific to the design of the Progress (e.g. wanting to see an FAQ inside of the Help link instead of steps)

### **Full Page Calendar**

The Full Page Calendar was tested using a tool called "FullCalendar.io" that was embedded into the prototype. The only functionality tested was the month view.

1. Several participants felt that the calendar was simple and easy to use.
2. Some participants stated that they would prefer to see the month view first, while others wanted to see the week view by default.
3. Some participants mentioned that they liked that it gave the option to toggle between day, week, and month.
4. Some participants stated that the calendar is similar to other software they have used (i.e. Google, Excel)
5. A couple participants turned the smartphone landscape because they did not like the portrait view.
6. Some participants had difficulty selecting a time.
7. One participant stated that they felt the calendar was not clear and did not know the current day was highlighted.
8. One participant felt that the calendar was too basic and did not do much.
9. One participant felt that switching between the views was confusing and expected to see a drop down when selecting a date and time.
10. One participant stated that they wanted to see the available appointments.

### **Tree Structure**

1. Six participants selected the name instead of the arrow to expand the section
2. Three participants did not use the tree structure to complete the tasks.
3. Some participants were concerned about making edits to the tree structure and did not want to mess up the structure.

### **Summary**

1. Overall, participants generally liked everything and felt it was easy and straightforward.
2. Some participants were confused about why they would complete these tasks on a phone. Most likely due to readability or security concerns.
3. Some participant had difficulty selecting items on the phone due to their fingers or gestures. One mentioned that without a stylus it was difficult to select items on the screen.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Based on this round of testing, the following patterns were found to be problematic for enough participants to necessitate retesting or design refinements:

- Progress
- Full Page Calendar
- Tree Structure

Pattern recommendations based on the findings are below.

| Pattern  | Recommendation  |  Rationale  |
|---|---|---|
|Drop Down |Continue with the current design. |There were no major issues with this pattern.|
|Loading Button| Continue with the current design. |There were no major issues with this pattern.|
|Progress| Re-evaluate including more information about the current step. |Most participants did not realize the purpose of this pattern.|
|Popover| Continue with current design.| There were no major issues with this pattern.|
|Full Page Calendar| Re-evaluate filter options. Re-evaluate allowing users to select an actual date instead of a pre-selected date. | Participants wanted to see dates with times availability.|
|Tree Structure |Consider testing again within a new context to verify the issues are with the Tree Structure pattern and not with the scenario given to the user. |Participants did not click on the icon of the tree structure; rather they click on the text.|
