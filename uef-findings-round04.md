# Round 4 UEF Pattern Usability Findings

## Background

The Mobile UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate how a complex, linear application could be designed to work on mobile as well as desktop devices, using a responsive design approach. The existing iAppeals application was modified to evaluate:

1. A proposed navigation structure allowing for linear progression as well as the ability to navigate to prior sections; and
2. UEF patterns that might pose usability issues on smaller screens, thus needing further analysis or redesign.

The Mobile UEF team also sought to identify any emerging trends or patterns since beginning mobile usability testing this year. Patterns tested during this round included:

- Definition Link
- State
- SSN
- Date (of Event)
- Error Summary
- Password (Create)
- Save this Page Link
- Secondary Navigation

Testing was conducted on the following types of devices:

- Smartphones (iOS and Android)
- Tablet (iPad)
- Desktop (PC)

## What We Did

With members of the general public, Mobile UEF Team members:

- Conducted user testing with eleven participants at the Charles P. Miller Branch of the Howard County Public Library in Ellicott City, MD, on October 23, 2013.
  - Participants tested on one of the following types of devices:
    - Mobile smartphone: 5 total participants (4 using an iPhone 5; 1 using a Samsung Galaxy S3)
    - iPad tablet: 4 participants
    - Desktop: 2 participants
- Collected participant information in a pre-test demographic survey, which showed:
  - Participants ranged in age from 38-72 with a median age of 46
  - Ten of the eleven participants owned and used at least one type of mobile device
  - Two of the eleven participants had used Social Security’s online service to apply for, or to access, their benefits. (One participant did not complete this question.)
- Analyzed the results, including:
  - Navigation methods and preferences
  - Participant issues or comments re: specific UEF patterns or screen details
  - User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in a post-test questionnaire

## Challenges & Constraints

As with prior Mobile UEF testing sessions, recruiting of volunteer participants was performed on-site during the testing session with outreach to a broad range of library patrons. The usability test scenario and task were designed to be completed within 15-20 minutes, as prior mobile testing had shown this amount of time to yield the optimal balance of participants and data for analysis in any single testing day.

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the UXG as follows:

- Completion Rate – Percentage of test participants who successfully complete the application without assistance
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- Ease of Use – Percentage of test participants who indicated the application was “very easy” to use on Question #5 of the post-test survey
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- User Satisfaction – User satisfaction score, per post-test questionnaire
  - Target = 80% for each device type

## What We Learned

For each metric, actual performance exceeded the target for each device type.

| Metric  | Target (All)  | Actual (Phone)  | Actual (Tablet)  | Actual (Desktop)  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate  | 80%  | 100%  | 100%  | 100%  |
| Ease of Use  | 80%  | 100%  | 100%  | 100%  |
| User Satisfaction  | 80%  | 86%  | 89%  | 94%  |

## Qualitative Assessment

Usability issues, as well as observations and participant comments of note, are listed below.

### NAVIGATION

#### **“Go to” Menu Button Display**

The "Go to…" display that allows the user to go directly to completed sections of the application was visible as a button on the tablet (in portrait orientation) and the smartphones.

Smartphone

- 1 of the 5 participants went directly to the “Go to…” button to go back to a particular section in the application and again to return to where he had left off.
- Of the 4 remaining participants, 2 used the “Go to…” button to return to where they’d left off in the application; the other 2 instead clicked the “Next” button to page forward, despite it taking longer

Tablet

- 2 of the 4 participants used the “Go to…” button to go back to a particular section in the application and then return to where they’d left off.
- 1 of the remaining participants used it to return to her prior place in the application after the functionality was explained by the facilitator; the other used the “Next” button to page forward

### UEF PATTERNS

#### **Definition Link**

9 of the 11 participants did not know what “AR” meant but still did not click the definition link for more information.

Smartphone

- 1 participant construed the dotted underline to indicate a misspelling.
- 2 participants stated the link should be blue; 1 because the lines are so small and 1 because it would be clearer
- 1 participant indicated he noticed the dotted lines but didn’t know what they meant

Tablet

- 2 of the 4 tablet participants clicked the definition link for more information

Desktop

- The 2 desktop participants did not know what AR meant but did not click the definition link

![Definition Link](/screenshots/round-4/02-definition-link.png)

#### **State Input**

- 2 iPhone users were confused after clicking the dropdown: they expected to see states but saw only Armed Forces input options due to fewer options visible on the iOS scroll wheel. This input was not problematic for the Android phone users.
  - 1 of these 2 participants stated “it would be better if states were shown first”
- There were no issues or comments for tablet or desktop users

![State Pattern](/screenshots/round-4/03-state.png)

#### **SSN Input**

- 2 mobile phone participants commented on the SSN format; 1 would like it “chunked” and 1 stated it would be easier to use if dashes were “automatically put in”
- There were no issues or comments for tablet or desktop users

![Social Security Number Pattern](/screenshots/round-4/04-ssn.png)

#### **Date (of Event)**

- 1 mobile phone participant expected to input Date of Birth via a single scroll wheel providing month, day & year, vs. individual wheels or inputs
- There were no issues or comments for tablet or desktop users

![Date Pattern](/screenshots/round-4/05-date-of-event.png)

#### **Error Summary Notice**

- 2 participants suggested the links would be more useful by providing additional information such as the location of check routing and account numbers
- The only participants who clicked on the error links provided in this pattern were 2 tablet users
- There were no issues or comments from desktop users

![Password Matching Indicator](/screenshots/round-4/08-password-match.png)

#### **“Save This Page” Link**

The link was problematic in general across device types re: what was actually being saved. Once shown, participants wanted a variety of options to save the Reentry #.

Smartphone

- At least 2 participants believed they were saving the entire application vs. simply the screen with the reentry #
- 1 of these 2 participants raised the issue that access to his information would now be on someone else’s phone (per the testing scenario)
- The other participant thought she could now access the saved page online versus her phone; she did not expect a download onto the device
- 2 participants would like options for saving the Reentry number such as saving to notes or emailing to themselves.

Tablet

- 1 participant voiced uncertainty as to where on the device itself the pdf would be saved
- After seeing what happened with the link was clicked, 1 participant stated he’d like to take a screenshot of it; another would like to email it to himself
- 1 participant thought information would be saved to both her desktop AND ssa.gov

## Next Steps

Based on this round of testing, the following patterns were noted to a Mobile UEF pattern “watch list” to monitor moving forward. These patterns did not cause participants notable difficulty in completing their tasks, but may be candidates for future improvements:

- Date of Event
- State Input

Additionally, the following patterns will undergo further design and testing:

- Definition Link
- The Save this Page link
