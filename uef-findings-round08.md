# Round 8 UEF Pattern Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 8 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The Mobile UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a linear application on mobile and desktop devices. The existing iClaim application was modified to evaluate particular patterns, including:

- Password (Create)
- Date Calendar
- Application Steps (new pattern)
- Basic Table
- Summary (Enhanced and Receipt)
- Document Viewer
- Standard Template Footer

Testing was conducted on the following types of devices:

- Smartphones (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (iOS and Android)

## The Prototype

### Design

The existing iClaim application was modified to incorporate several new patterns. The team chose a linear path application in order to test the new Application Steps pattern. Each screen within the path incorporated at least one pattern being evaluated.

### Viewport Sizes

As with prior responsive prototypes used in Mobile UEF testing, this prototype was designed with a single breakpoint. The devices with a viewport size of < 768 pixels when used in portrait view included: the iPhone 5, iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S3, and Samsung Galaxy S5.

The devices with a viewport size of 768 and larger included the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and iPad.

The viewport sizes for each mobile device used in this round of testing are as follows:

| Mobile Device  | Viewport Size  | Operating System  |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone 5  | 320 x 568  | iOS  |
| Samsung Galaxy S3  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| Samsung Galaxy S5  | 360 x 640  | Android  |
| iPhone 6  | 375 x 667  | iOS  |
| iPad  | 768 x 1024  | iOS  |
| Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1  | 800 x 1280  | Android  |

## What We Did

With members of the general public, Mobile UEF Team members:

- Conducted user testing with 14 participants at Stevenson University in Owings Mills, MD on February 5, 2015.
  - Fourteen participants tested on one of the following types of devices:
    - Smartphone: 9 total participants
      - 2 using an iPhone 5
      - 4 using an iPhone 6
      - 1 using a Samsung Galaxy S3
      - 2 using a Samsung Galaxy S5
    - Tablet: 5 total participants
      - 4 using an iPad
      - 1 using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
    - No desktop users were tested.
- Collected participant information in a pre-test demographic survey, which indicated:
  - Participants ranged in age from 18 to 65, with a median age of 23;
  - All 14 participants owned and used at least one type of mobile device;
  - Thirteen participants had not used Social Security’s online services;
  - Thirteen participants would use a tablet or a smartphone to access SSA.gov or a MySocialSecurity account.
- Analyzed the results, including:
  - Navigation methods and preferences;
  - Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
  - User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in a post-test questionnaire.

## Challenges & Constraints

As with prior Mobile UEF testing sessions, recruiting of volunteer participants was performed on-site during the testing session with outreach to a broad range of college patrons. The usability test scenario and tasks were designed to be completed within 15-20 minutes; prior mobile testing had shown this time range yielded the optimal balance of participants and data in any single day.

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the Mobile UEF Workgroup as follows:

- **Completion Rate** – Percentage of test participants who successfully complete the application without assistance
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- **Ease of Use** – Percentage of test participants who indicated the application was “very easy” to use on Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- **User Satisfaction** – Percentage of test participants who indicated they were “very satisfied” on questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey
  - Target = 80% for each device type

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target (All)  | Actual (Phone)  | Actual (Tablet)  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate  | 80%  | 100%  | 100%  |
| Ease of Use  | 80%  | 85.8%  | 92%  |
| User Satisfaction  | 80%  | 90%  | 90%  |

### UEF PATTERNS

#### **Password (Create)**

Small Breakpoint

- One smartphone participant did not meet all the password criteria but decided to move on anyway.
- One smartphone participant was not sure if the symbol she entered was incorrect or ‘x’ symbol “wrong” and asked "Do I need to enter [this], or I am not supposed to use it?"
- One smartphone participant thought the password requirements were merely suggestions.
- One smartphone participant was unclear if the requirements were associated with the password field below.

Large Breakpoint

- One tablet participant did not meet all the password criteria but decided to move on anyway.
- One tablet participant expected a password strength indicator.

#### **Date Calendar**

This pattern included dates in one visible state: light gray (indicating unavailable dates)

Small Breakpoint

- There were no major functionality issues
- Two participants used the new month drop-down list to change months.
- One smartphone participant preferred the Date Calendar pattern over the Date (Drop Down) pattern, commenting “The calendar is nice, easier than [the drop-down] numbers.”
- Five participants expected the gray dates to indicate holidays, or otherwise unavailable dates.
- One smartphone participant thought the gray dates indicated either deadlines, the current date, or already selected dates.
- Three participants did not know why the dates were gray.

Large Breakpoint

- There were no major functionality issues.
- One participant used the new month drop-down list to change months.
- One tablet participant preferred the Date Calendar pattern over the Date (Drop Down) pattern.
- One tablet participant preferred using the Date (Drop Down) pattern rather than the Date Calendar pattern for selecting a date. (Both patterns appeared on the same page of the prototype.) According to participant, "It's easier, especially if you are picking a date that's far in the future."
- One tablet participant expected the gray dates to indicate holidays, or otherwise unavailable dates.
- Three participants thought the gray dates indicated either deadlines, the current date, or already selected dates.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Based on this round of testing, the following patterns were found to be problematic for enough participants to necessitate retesting or design refinements:

- Password (Create) (retesting)
- Basic Table

Recommendations based on the findings are below.

| Pattern  | Recommendation  |  Rationale  |
|---|---|---|
| Password (Create)  | Re-evaluate the Password (Create) pattern in conjunction with the proposed redesign of the Username pattern.  | The two patterns are often used in tandem and should be consistent with regard to placement of requirements. |
| Date (Calendar) | Continue with the current design. | There were no major issues with this pattern. |
| Application Steps | Continue with the current design but consider being consistent with the chevron icons and functionality across all UEF patterns. | There were no major issues with this pattern. |
| Basic Table | Consider being consistent with the chevron icons and functionality across all UEF patterns. Re-test and continue to note any further issues when testing future UEF table patterns. | Participants were either not aware or unsure if there was extra information for each row. |
| Review Summary | Continue with the current design but consider re-testing with the Error Check Page. | There were no major issues with this pattern. |
| Document Viewer | Continue with the current design. | There were no major issues with this pattern. |
| Footer (links) | Continue with the current design. | There were no major issues with this pattern. |
