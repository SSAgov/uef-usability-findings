# Round 1 UEF Pattern Usability Findings

## Background

The User Experience Framework (UEF) team at Social Security Administration (SSA) conducted usability testing on August 7, 2013 at Enoch Pratt Library in Baltimore, MD. This research was conducted to learn more about the basic patterns intended for use in the User Experience Framework (UEF) version 2.0. This is the first round of usability testing for the effort to upgrade the design system to a responsive framework.

Patterns used in this round of testing included:

- Public Template
- Container (Basic)
- Container (Tabs)
- Buttons
- Address (US)
- Check Box
- Drop List
- Password
- Phone (US)
- Radio List
- Modal (Lightbox)
- Form Controls
- Show/Hide Content

The prototype used was a fake application based on mySSA Benefits. It guided the participant through a series of tasks that asked them to complete the following:

1. Log in to their account
2. Check their account information
3. Update their address
4. Change their password
5. Find information about their Medicare program
6. Update phone number and cancel action
7. Sign out of the application

Participants were then asked some post-test questions about their overall thoughts.

## Issues Found

### Main Page

- Menus within the topmost container were perceived as global navigation, especially by participants testing on mobile devices
- Overall, the amount of information was good
  - Some stated that if there was more information on the page it would be too much
  - Others thought that if they could access key sections quickly via the menu or other means, it might be fine to have more
  - “Unless you know to scroll you’ll miss out on a lot” was the feeling of at least one participant (64 years old, using mobile device, does own a smartphone)

### Menu

- Some wanted the sections from the main page to also be included in the menu
- At least one participant (34 years old, iPhone user) wanted “Either everything on the page, or everything in the menu.” She did not see the point of the Menu with so few things in it.
- Some participants wanted a way to quickly and easily access the different sections on the page, a way to “click and go,” (p6), whether that was by:
  - Listing all the links under the Menu button;
  - Providing a “drop-down bar for options for everything that could be accessed on the page’; or
  - “Headers across the top [top navigation] that would make it easier to find things like contact information and Medicare.”

### Update Contact Info

- Drop downs appear grayed out because of the way they are represented in iOS (OS issue and not design issue)
- One participant thought ‘Cancel’ would close the program and resorted to the browser back button “because there’s no menu button” or “Back” button
- Many others also used the browser back button to get back to the previous page instead of selecting ‘Cancel.’ This may be because the browser back button has become routine for most people.

### Find Password

- Couldn’t find how to update password because the ‘Security Settings’ label was not intuitive (language issue—not design)
- Some participants looked under the Menu for ‘Change My Password’ or the like
- Some participants thought it might be in the Contact Information section
- Because ‘Security Settings’ was not intuitive, participants were unsure as to what they would find if selected
- Expected an account section that would include ‘Change Password’ or ‘My Information’ or ‘Profile’
- On the desktop version, one participant expected ‘Change Password’ to be in the right column in the gray box.  He thought of this area more as ‘quick links.’

### Medicare

- Links did not afford opening because there was no icon with them
- Participants therefore did not expect them to open or know how to “shrink” the area (close)
- Some participants looked in the Menu for Medicare
- Some participants thought it would be with the Medicare Card information (under Request a Replacement)

### Sign Out

- No issues with sign out
