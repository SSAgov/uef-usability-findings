# Round 17 UEF Pattern Testing Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 17 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The User Experience Framework (UEF) team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a non-linear Pro Template application prototype on desktop devices.
The following patterns were evaluated in Round 17 Testing:

- PRO Template Responsive Tabs
- PRO Template Mega Menu Tab
- PRO Template Collapsible Panels
- Mobile Mega Menu
- Input Table with Errors
- Input Table Inline Editing
- Table Column Selector
- Back to Top (A/B grey and orange colors)
- Radio List Series
- Text Area (Rich Text)
- Phone (US) (new formatting)
- EIN (new formatting)

## Methodology

The User Experience Group (UXG) UEF team conducted usability testing with six participants on June 18-19, 2019. The evaluations took place in the UXG labs at SSA. All evaluations were conducted on desktop computers.

Rapid Iterative Testing Evaluation (RITE) was the method of choice during round 17. The team conducted three rounds of evaluations with two participants at a time (six total participants). After each round, the facilitators and the UXG UEF team met for a half hour debrief. During each debrief the team discussed the issues found and potential changes to the patterns that would be shown to the next set of participants.

During each evaluation, participants walked through a series of scenarios that allowed them to look at each of the patterns being tested. The prototype design was a fictitious internal application to review a vendor management system. In order for the prototype to be iterative, it was built with HTML and CSS using the UXG Genesys Design Tool.

After the evaluations were complete, the team analyzed the results including:

- Facilitator Guide metrics on ease of use;
- Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
- User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in the post-test questionnaire.

## Participant Information

Six participants were involved in the evaluations. Their demographic information was as follows:

- Participants were between the ages of 37 and 60 with an average age of 47
- Five out of six participants have a degree of higher education (4-year or graduate)
  - Three participants have a grad degree
  - Two participants have a 4-year degree
  - One participant has some college
- All participants access the internet on a Desktop, Tablet and Smartphone
- Two participants have a mySocialSecurity account online banking
- Three participants would use a desktop or laptop to access SSA.gov
  - Two participants would use a smartphone

## Lessons Learned

The UXG team discussed lessons learned from this round of testing. Those included the following:

- Request time out extension from TDOT to prevent lockout screen from interrupting testing session on observer side.
- Conduct a dry run with adequate time to allow updates to the guide or prototype if needed before testing.
- Rite methodology worked well again.
- When recruiting, have facilitators send an email directly to Amy and she will sign them up. If someone is on our "no fly list", tell them politely that we have no spots available.

## Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the UEF Workgroup as follows. Each has a target of 80%.

- Completion Rate – Percentage of participants who successfully completed the application without assistance
- Ease of Use – Percentage of participants who indicated the application was “easy” or “very easy” to use, as measured by Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
- User Satisfaction – Percentage of participants who indicated they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied,” as measured by questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target  | Actual  |
|---|---|---|
|Completion Rate|>=80%|100%|
|Ease of Use|>=80%|84%|
|User Satisfaction|>=80%|81%|
