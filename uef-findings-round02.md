# Round 2 UEF Pattern Usability Findings

## Background

The User Experience Framework (UEF) team at Social Security Administration (SSA) conducted usability testing on August 14, 2013 at Glenwood Community Center in Columbia, MD. This research was conducted to learn more about patterns intended for use in the Social Security Administration (SSA) User Experience Framework (UEF) version 2.0. The methodology of this round was kept the same to learn if the use of the patterns in a different demographic location made a difference. The prototype was updated slightly to accomodate for findings from the previous round of testing.

Patterns used in this round of testing included:

- Public Template
- Container (Basic)
- Container (Tabs)
- Buttons
- Address (US)
- Bank Information
- Check Box
- Drop List
- Password
- Phone (US)
- Radio List
- Modal (Lightbox)
- Form Controls
- Show/Hide Content

The prototype used was a fake application based on mySSA Benefits. It guided the participant through a series of tasks that asked them to complete the following:

1. Log in to their account
2. Check their account information
3. Update their address
4. Change their password
5. Find information about their Medicare program
6. Update direct deposit and cancel action
7. Sign out of the application

Participants were then asked some post-test questions about their overall thoughts.

## Issues Found

### Payment History

- Many issues were because of lack of familiarity with the site.
  - Some participants tried to go into earnings record and thought their benefits history might have been in there. They eventually found it after looking around some more.
  - Many participants could not find it at first and were just scrolling around. They eventually found it.
  - One participant could not find payment history at first. Once found they thought it was unclear as to what “history” meant. Did not think it would have what it did.

### Update Contact information

- No major issues with updating contact information
- One participant got to the confirmation and stopped. Eventually hit done and continued on to main page.
- Another participant entered the state into the city field but immediately caught it and fixed it.

### Link List and Menu

- Link List at the top was taking away from the prominence of the menu
- Many ignored the menu and prominently used the link list for navigation instead.

### Medicare Drop Down

- No major issues finding the Medicare section

### Cancel Out of Task

Participants used a variety of ways to cancel out of direct deposit including the top cancel button, the bottom cancel button, the browser back button, and the next button.
Sign Out

By the end, participants had a familiarity with the menu and instinctively knew to the top to find “sign out”
There were no major issues signing out.
Other Comments

One participant wanted the location of password to be in the contact information section.
Other participants also commented on having one major account settings area that included contact information, password, etc.
Most participants liked the design and thought it was easy to use.
Many participants stated that once they found what they were looking for, they would know where it was and would not have a problem the next time.
