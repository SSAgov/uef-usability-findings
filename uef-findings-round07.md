# Round 7 UEF Pattern Usability Findings

Results overview from Round 7 of the user feedback sessions

## Background

The Mobile UEF team conducted usability testing to evaluate specific UEF patterns in the context of a linear application on mobile and desktop devices. The existing MySSA application was modified to evaluate particular patterns, including two different Container with Tabs styles and a refined Navigation design. The Mobile UEF team also sought to identify any emerging trends or patterns since beginning mobile usability testing in August 2013. Patterns tested during this round included:

- Container with Tabs
- Date Picker
- Navigation/Steps
- Review Summary
- Document Viewer
- Buttons (Standard & Secondary)

Testing was conducted on the following types of devices:

- Smartphones (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (iPad)

## The Prototype

### Design

The MySSA portal used for testing was modified to allow for the use of specific patterns the Mobile UEF wished to test. This included the use of two different Container with Tabs pattern styles currently being evaluated: a slide menu style and a tabbed style. These patterns were displayed vertically in that order in the prototype.

From the MySSA portal the participant was launched into a mock iAppeals application in order to test several new patterns, including the proposed new navigation pattern. This new pattern was intended to replace the Application Sections, Application Tabs, and Steps patterns; at the smaller display size it is hidden but represented by a List icon.

### Viewport Sizes

As with prior responsive prototypes used in Mobile UEF testing, this prototype was designed with a single breakpoint. The devices with a viewport size of < 768 pixels included: the iPhone 5, iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy S5.

The devices with a viewport size of 768 and larger included an iPad.

The viewport sizes for each mobile device used in this round of testing are as follows:

- iPhone 5 320 x 568
- Samsung Galaxy S5 360 x 640
- iPhone 6 375 x 667
- iPad 768 x 1024

## What We Did

With members of the general public, Mobile UEF Team members:

- Conducted user testing with 10 participants at the White Marsh Branch of the Baltimore County Public Library in White Marsh, MD, on November 13, 2014.
  - Ten participants tested on one of the following types of devices:
    - Mobile smartphone: 5 total participants
      - 1 using an iPhone 5;
      - 2 using an iPhone 6;
      - 2 using a Samsung Galaxy S5
    - Tablet: 5 participants using an iPad 3
    - No desktop users were tested in this round due to internet connectivity issues discovered upon arrival at the venue.
- Collected participant information in a pre-test demographic survey, which showed:
  - Participants ranged in age from 23-72, with a median age of 44;
  - Eight of the 10 participants owned and used at least one type of mobile device;
  - Six of the 10 participants had used Social Security’s online service to apply for, or to access, their benefits;
  - Five of the 10 participants would use a tablet or smartphone to access SSA.gov or a MySocialSecurity account.
- Analyzed the results, including:
  - Navigation methods and preferences;
  - Participant issues or comments regarding specific UEF patterns or screen details;
  - User satisfaction scores on the overall experience as indicated in a post-test questionnaire.

## Challenges & Constraints

As with prior Mobile UEF testing sessions, recruiting of volunteer participants was performed on-site during the testing session with outreach to a broad range of library patrons. The usability test scenario and tasks were designed to be completed within 15-20 minutes; prior mobile testing had shown this time range yielded the optimal balance of participants and data in any single day.

Metrics

Metrics for this usability test were established by the UXG as follows:

- **Completion Rate** – Percentage of test participants who successfully complete the application without assistance
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- **Ease of Use** – Percentage of test participants who indicated the application was “very easy” to use on Questions #3, #5, and #8 of the post-test survey
  - Target = 80% for each device type
- **User Satisfaction** – Percentage of test participants who indicated they were “very satisfied” on questions #4 and #7 of the post-test survey
  - Target = 80% for each device type

## What We Learned

Metrics for task completion, ease of use and user satisfaction, as measured by the post-test questionnaire, were as follows:

| Metric  | Target (All)  | Actual (Phone)  | Actual (Tablet)  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate  | 80%  | 100%  | 100%  |
| Ease of Use  | 80%  | 80%  | 80%  |
| User Satisfaction  | 80%  | 80%  | 100%  |

## Qualitative Assessment

Usability issues, as well as observations and participant comments, are listed below.

Small Breakpoint: Below 768 pixels (n=5)

Large Breakpoint: 768 pixels and above (n=5)

### UEF PATTERNS

#### **Container with Tabs (Slide Menu)**

- There were no major issues with the functionality of the Slide Menu container.
- One participant stated that they did not like the fact that the words cut off. (Note: Only the first 3 letters of the 3rd tab, “Overpayments” were visible to the user without scrolling.)They felt it was difficult to find the information.
- One participant liked the fact that the words were cut off because they felt that and the arrow together pointed to something hidden.
- No major issues on the large breakpoint.

#### **Container with Tabs (More Menu)**

- There were no major issues with the More Menu style Container with Tabs.
- “It’s right there.” *(Participant quote referring to the more menu drop down)*
- No major issues on the large breakpoint.
- “It’s easy.” *(Participant quote referring to the overall tabbed container)*

#### **Date Picker**

This pattern included dates in two visible states: either dark gray (indicating a previous or future month) or light gray (indicating unavailable dates).

Small Breakpoint

- There were no major functionality issues
- Three participants stated that the dark gray dates were either unavailable or belonged to the previous or next month.
- Three participants stated that the light gray dates were unavailable because of the weekend.
- Two participants did not know what the dark gray dates were.
- One participant did not know what the light gray dates were.

Large Breakpoint

- There were no major functionality issues.
- Four participants stated that the dark gray dates were unavailable because they belonged to the previous or next month.
- The same four participants also understood that the light gray dates were unavailable because of the weekend.
- One participant thought that the dark gray dates were days that were filled up by other users and the light gray days were open days that were available.

#### **Navigation/Steps**

- Three of the five smartphone participants did not notice the List icon to open the steps pattern.
- One participant stated that they did not know what the list icon was and it did not look familiar to them.
- One participant attempted to use the browser “Back” button to navigate to the previous page.
- Two participants attempted to navigate to the previous page by using the “Previous” button. This could be due to the participants not noticing the list icon.
- No major issues on the large breakpoint because the steps were not hidden in this view.
- Two participants attempted to navigate to the previous page by using the “Previous” button.

#### **Review Summary**

Small Breakpoint

- There were no major issues with the Review Summary.
- All participants thought the review summary looked good and understood that it was the information they had previously entered.
- One participant found the Edit button with prompting from the facilitator.
- Two participants expected to edit the information directly on the summary page.
- Three participants stated that they would not submit the application until the missing information was completed.

Large Breakpoint

- No major issues.
- All participants thought the review summary looked good and understood that it was the information they previously entered.
- One participant expected to edit the information directly on the summary page.

#### **Document Viewer**

This pattern was updated to include a “Back” button on the smaller screen size in replace of the traditional “X”.

- There were no major issues with the Document Viewer on either breakpoint.
- One participant was hesitant to use the back button because they were afraid they would lose the information.
- One participant did not understand the wording of the Help link (i.e. Can’t print or Save).
- One participant stated they would rather the close icon be a button that said “Return to Previous Page”

### Standard vs. Secondary Buttons

Another item that was looked at during testing was the use of the Secondary button as a Standard button. The Mobile UEF team decided to test this to see if the current dark gray Standard button could be replaced with the white and blue Secondary button; leaving UEF with two types of buttons instead of three.
Results showed that none of the participants had difficulty using the Secondary style button as a Standard button. Participants understood that the blue outline with blue text indicated that it was clickable.

### Container with Tabs Preference

During the post-task questions, participants were asked to provide their preference between the two different Container with Tab styles they encountered earlier in the scenarios: the Slide Menu style and the More Menu style. The results are shown in the tables below:

| Favorite Container  | # of Participants  |
|---|---|
| Slide Menu  | 2  |
| More Menu  | 7  |
| No Preference  | 1  |

#### **More Menu**

Participants stated that they liked the More Menu style container because the tabs were less obscured, easier to access, more obvious to the eye, or just overall liked the look of the tabs better. One of the two participants who did not like the More Menu stated it was because they were unsure if older people would notice it and therefore not click on it. The other felt that because they looked like tabs, they would go to a different page entirely.

#### **Slide Menu**

One participant who preferred the Slide Menu because the arrow and the cut-off word together point to something hidden (indicate there is more content). The other participant stated it was because the tabs looked like links and would thereby keep him on the same page. Of the seven participants who did not like the Slide menu said it was because it was more work or they just liked the other design better for no particular reason.

### Missing Information Pages

During the task in which participants navigated through a process, two of the pages in that process were used to gather feedback on what the user would do if they did not readily have the information for that page. When participants arrived at the Review page, the words “No Answer” in bold and italics appeared in that section. The first page was designed with blank fields and the other was the same page with errors.

While on the blank page, participants told facilitators they would do one the following:

- Leave the page blank and select ‘Save & Continue’ (5/10)
- Select ‘Save & Exit’ and find the information  (4/10)
- Leave the page on the screen until the information is found (1/10)

When participants arrived on the error page, they told facilitators they would do one of the following:

- Select ‘Save & Exit’ and find the information (4/10)
- Leave the page on the screen until the information is found (6/10)

### File Link Download Expectation

At the end of the scenarios, four participants were shown a page that had the five different file link types on it. These file types included PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Zip (file archive). Participants were asked what they would expect to happen if they clicked on each of the different link types. All four participants expected for all five files types to open immediately in an application without downloading to the device.

Prior to testing, we looked into what actually happens for each file type. Most devices will download all five file types directly to the device. However, the action for file types is dependent upon which operating system (iOS, Android, etc.) your device has, and is also affected by the applications found on the device. As new devices come to market with new operating systems and/or applications, these findings may change.

### Increased Font Size

For this round of testing, all the font sizes were increased by 2 pixels, putting the standard text at a 16px font size. Facilitators took note if participants made any comments about the font size, scrolling, or readability. Three of the 10 participants (two iPad, one iPhone 6) stated that they would prefer an even larger font size than that used in this testing prototype.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Based on this round of testing, the following patterns were found to be problematic for enough participants to necessitate a new or revised design:

- Navigation/Steps
- Date Picker

Recommendations based on the findings are below.

| Pattern  | Recommendation  |  Rationale  |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation/Steps  | Re-evaluate an alternate icon for this pattern; refine and re-test.  | Participants did not notice the steps icon and needed prompting from the facilitator to use it.  |
| Review Summary  | Continue with the current design but consider re-testing with missing information to probe deeper into the participants’ expectations for this situation.  | This situation was not looked into this round and may necessitate testing. |
| Date Picker  | Re-evaluate the design for the dark and light gray dates. | Participants perceived the dark gray dates as unavailable when they actually were. |
| Container with Tabs  | Consider using the More Menu design for the container with tabs pattern.  | This was the preferred container and there were little-to-no issues involved.  |
| Document Viewer  | Continue with the current design but consider re-testing to probe more closely at the drop down menu.  | The drop down menu in the document viewer was not thoroughly tested this round.  |
| Font Size  | Continue with the font size at 16px.  | There were no major issues while using this font size. |
| File Type Links | Continue to evaluate ways to mitigate any potential issues with downloading and opening file types. | The participants’ expectation for downloading the file types is the opposite of what actually happens. |
| Buttons (Secondary & Standard)  | Continue using the Secondary style button as a Standard button in order to remove the extra third button. | Participants had no issues distinguishing the Secondary style buttons as clickable. |
